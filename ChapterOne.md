8x8x8x1280x1024=671088640
Six hundred and seventy one million bits > 6.71 seconds.

1.5a
P1 @ 3 GHz, CPI 1.5, > 3/1.5 = 2 billion instructions per second (GIPS)
P2 @ 2.5 GHz, CPI 1.0 > 2.5/1 = 2.5 billion instructions per second (GIPS)
P3 @ 4.0 Ghz, cpi 2.2 > 4/2.2 = 1.8 billion instructions per second (GIPS)

P2 is fastest.

1.5b.
P1 > 20 billion instructions
P2 > 25 billion instructions
P3 > 18 billion instructions

P1 > 30 billion clock cycles
P2 > 25 billion clock cycles
P3 > 40 billion clock cycles

1.5c. Note
*Page 34 Example: 
*Clock speed for four second improvement in execution time of processor?

*Defination of Hertz: ticks/seconds=Hertz

*Given processor:
*20 GigaTicks/10 seconds = 2GHz

I*mproved processor

*Speedup penalty: 20% more ticks.
*20 GigaTicks*1.2/6 seconds = 4Ghz

Clock speed for 30% improvement in execution time of processor?*

P1

Given processor: P1 @ 
Assume 20 10^9 instructions
2 10^9 instructions per second (GIPS)
CPI 1.5
execution time: 10
Clock Rate:3  GHz

Improved processor:
Assume 2 10^9 instructions
2 10^9 instructions per second (GIPS)
CPI = 1.5 X 1.2
execution time: 7
Clock Rate?



Note: Clock speed is the combination of a hardware ocillator and multipliers. The clock speed can be adjusted by BIOS settings for a single chip and the penalty is heat. In a new design, the penalty can be increased instructions.
