### Proposed Answers for Chapter One


__1.1__

Pc, warehouse, super computers, and personal mobile devices are mentioned by the authors, but for a grander view of the scope of computing have a look at the types of Linux distributions [here](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions)

1.2
|          Real World         |          Computing         |
|:---------------------------:|:--------------------------:|
|                   Elevators | Common case                |
|             Assembly  lines | Piplining                  |
|           Navigtion systems | Performancd via prediction |
|           Suspension bridge | Parallelism                |
|        Library service desk | Memories                   |
| Dependibility via redunancy | CMOS                       |
|           Self driving cars | Abstraction                |
|                   Catapults | Moore's Law                |


Note: Methaphor is in the eye of the beholder.

__1.3__

The compiler translates code to assembly language and the assembler then
translates the assembly language to machine code.

__1.4__

8x8x8x1280x1024 = 671,088,640
Six hundred and seventy one million bits > 6.71 seconds.

P1 @ 3 GHz, CPI 1.5, > 3/1.5 = 2 billion instructions per second (GIPS)
P2 @ 2.5 GHz, CPI 1.0 > 2.5/1 = 2.5 billion instructions per second (GIPS)
P3 @ 4.0 Ghz, cpi 2.2 > 4/2.2 = 1.8 billion instructions per second (GIPS)

P2 is fastest.

1.5b.
P1 > 20 billion instructions
P2 > 25 billion instructions
P3 > 18 billion instructions

P1 > 30 billion clock cycles
P2 > 25 billion clock cycles
P3 > 40 billion clock cycles

1.5c. Note
*Page 34 Example: 
*Clock speed for four second improvement in execution time of processor?

*Defination of Hertz: ticks/seconds=Hertz

*Given processor:
*20 GigaTicks/10 seconds = 2GHz

I*mproved processor

*Speedup penalty: 20% more ticks.
*20 GigaTicks*1.2/6 seconds = 4Ghz

Clock speed for 30% improvement in execution time of processor?*

P1

Given processor: P1 @ 
Assume 20 10^9 instructions
2 10^9 instructions per second (GIPS)
CPI 1.5
execution time: 10
Clock Rate:3  GHz

Improved processor:
Assume 2 10^9 instructions
2 10^9 instructions per second (GIPS)
CPI = 1.5 X 1.2
execution time: 7
Clock Rate?



Note: Clock speed is the combination of a hardware ocillator and multipliers. The clock speed can be adjusted by BIOS settings for a single chip and the penalty is heat. In a new design, the penalty can be increased instructions.
